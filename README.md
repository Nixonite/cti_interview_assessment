# CTI Python interview assessment

How to get it running
*****

* [Download this free geoip database (about 60MB)](http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLite2-City.tar.gz) 
	
* Extract the mmdb file from the above download and put it in the local directory of `main.py`

* Add credentials found in the assessment prompt's PDF to the sample aws.config file and rename it to 'aws.config.json'

* Start a new virtualenv and install the packages from requirements.txt (assuming python 2.7)

* Install MySQL locally (I used version 5.7)
