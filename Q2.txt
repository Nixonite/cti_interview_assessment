* pass the bucket and key to the command line arguments.
    For simplicity of this specific project, I just put it into the config file.

* Buy the maxmind database license for a more accurate database

* Turn this program into a microservice so that non-python software can utilize it easily.
    Also it's a pain to download the database every time you want to run this program so there is
    another reason for doing this. 

* With more time I would fix potential path issues. Replace relative paths with 
    absolute ones generated by os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)) etc.
    At the current state, the program would break when run from any other directory.
